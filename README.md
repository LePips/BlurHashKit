# BlurHashKit

This Swift Package is a basic port of the [Swift implementation for BlurHash](https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash/tree/master/Swift/BlurHashKit). This was simply created to finally stop copying the contents over to new projects and create a separation of concern for the BlurHash implementation.
